# Cat and Dog Classifier



This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The model achieves an impressive accuracy of 98%.


## Introduction

This project aims to accurately classify images of cats and dogs using a CNN. The model was trained and evaluated on a large dataset, achieving a high accuracy rate.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of thousands of labeled images of cats and dogs.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model is composed of the following layers:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max pooling layers
- Fully connected (dense) layers
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting

## Results

The model achieved an accuracy of 98% on the validation set.
